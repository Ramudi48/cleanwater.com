        <h1>Water Sanitation</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Water sanitation refers to the process of ensuring that water<br> is safe for human consumption and use.
             It involves various methods to remove contaminants,<br> such as bacteria, viruses, chemicals, and pollutants,
              from water sources.<br> This is crucial to prevent waterborne diseases and maintain public health. Common sanitation
               techniques include filtration, disinfection (using chlorine, ozone, or ultraviolet light), and sedimentation to remove 
               impurities. Additionally, proper waste management and sewage treatment play significant roles in maintaining water sanitation by 
               preventing contamination of water bodies. Access to clean and safe water is essential for communities to thrive and is a fundamental
                aspect of sustainable development worldwide.</p>
